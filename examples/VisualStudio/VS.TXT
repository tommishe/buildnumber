This directory contains an image snapshot of the Project Properties
page from Visual Studio 2005. Note that BuildNumber should be defined
as a Pre-Build Event with Command Line, and the entire path should be
given (unless the BuildNumber executable is installed in a location 
already on the search path).

Also included in this directory is the Visual Studio project file for
BuildNumber itself. To use it, make sure you copy the project file to
the root source directory. See the README.TXT file for more information
on building BuildNumber with the project file. Make sure to specify 
which configuration you wish to build on the command line (Debug or
Release) as both will be built and overwrite each other if none is
specified.
